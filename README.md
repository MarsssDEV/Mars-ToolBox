This project is a web pentesting kit with some self-made tools from me. 
It was created to work on my GUI skills within Python.
The project is fully open source and I invite anyone to review my code.

To use the script, I've pasted the required PIP install links in "install.bat".
Double click this file and then you're good to go.
